description = For whatever reason, the rear end of this tail is slightly raised, giving it a straight look on the top. A few historical-nut kerbals also noticed something odd; this tail most likely belonged to not a biplane, but a triplane! It can still be used for the former though, so theres nothing to worry about. Just slap this anywhere!
